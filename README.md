# Budget Tracker

## Description
For this challenge we are given a functional budget tracking application and asked to add progressive web application functionality by using a service worker and indexedDB to make the app functional offline. We also add the option of installing the app directly to your computer or mobile device.

[Test the application out here!](https://protected-fortress-39036.herokuapp.com/)
